        <p>I am a 25 year old Filipino-San Diegan, born and raised. 
            My current industry field is healthcare with a specialty in histotechnology.
            What inspires me daily are my friends and loved ones.
            I like to find the humor in life wherever I can, some may say that I treat each interaction like a round of QuipLash.
            Astrology (I'm a capricorn sun, scorpio moon, and sag rising), videogames, and good food are what hold me together.
            My interest in web development came to me in highschool with a course in Internet Publishing, but my parents would not allow me to pursue this.
            Enrolling in this program is my duty to my passions, and upon completion I will have secured happiness from my highschool self.
