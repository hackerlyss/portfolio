# Portfolio for Alyssa Concepcion

This page is made from scratch to display a portfolio of my work. I needed a navbar to stay at the top of my page, and a main-body to display the main points of my portfolio. The sidebar has a list of languages that I currently know.
Here is a screenshot of my page: [Website preview](assets/images/Portfolio_screenshot.jpg)
